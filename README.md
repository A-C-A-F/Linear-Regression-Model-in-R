### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1. How to load and clean a real world data set. 
2. How to build a linear regression model and create various plots to analyze the model's performance.
3. How to predict future values using this model.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Load a real-world dataset and summarize it in R
- __Task 2:__ Clean our dataset
- __Task 3:__ Split our dataset into training and test set
- __Task 4:__ Build a linear regression model and interpret model summary statistics 
- __Task 5:__ Plot and analyze model residuals 
- __Task 6:__ Predict future values and calculate model error metrics
